This site is powered by [Jekyll][jekyll] because I finally got tired of
developing my own content management system. It is nice, it reads text files,
it is fast by design and it is expandable. If you are a software developer
yourself, go ahead and take a look at it.

I'm not using any kind of CSS framework here, but I included Nicolas Gallaghers
[normalize.css][normalize]. The font I am using is called Gandhi Sans, the
license and the font files can be found at [tipografiagandhi.com][font].

Last but not least: some ideas of my "design" are inspired by some drafts
[Marius Şucan][marius] did for me. He did the design three years ago and it
still looks charming. So I guess he is good at what he is doing. :)
