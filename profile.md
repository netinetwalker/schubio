# About myself

{% img bordered float-right /cfiles/profile_picture.jpg %}

My name is Dennis Schubert and I am a software developer born on September
17th, 1993. At the moment I am living somewhere between Stuttgart and Balingen,
both cities in southern Germany.

When I am not coding (or sleeping), I sometimes enjoy getting some fresh air
outside and I usually have my digital camera with me. All my photos are on
[flickr][flickr], most of them are licensed under some Creative Commons
license.

Somehow I fell in love with technology which is why I spend my days (and most of
my nights, too) with developing software and improving things. Some people may
call me a hacker, which may be the result of me being interested in software
security or the fact that I am obsessed with XMPP (and IRC), and my server
monitoring and my room heater's control speak XMPP with me. Yes, my heater's
control talks XMPP.

# Software development

Most of the time I develop web applications, thus I am able to create software
using JavaScript, Ruby, Python, C and even a bit of Rust.

When developing larger web application, I usually work with [Ruby on
Rails][rails]. I tend to build web applications with large portions of their
logic on the client and some of those applications are backed by
[Node.js][nodejs]. Since I do know Rails and I'm concerned about my privacy, I
really like the [Diaspora\* project][diaspora] where I am one of the core
developers who contributed to the project back in the beginning in 2010.

There is a [dedicated page about my projects][projects] and I suggest that you
check it out if you want to learn more about who I am and what I work on. Do not
hesitate to [contact me][contact] if you have any questions or if you want to
get in touch with me.

I gained a lot of professional experience in web development during my
employment as software engineer at a [small but nice web agency][wes] in
southern Germany where I started in 2010.

This profile is not complete, so please [ask me][contact] if you want to know
more about my professional experience and other projects I have done in the
past.
