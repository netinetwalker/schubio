# About myself

{% img bordered float-right /cfiles/profile_picture.jpg %}

My name is Dennis Schubert and I am a software developer born on September
17th, 1993. At the moment I am living somewhere between Stuttgart and Balingen,
both cities in southern Germany.

When I am not coding (or sleeping), I sometimes enjoy getting some fresh air
outside and I usually have my digital camera with me. All my photos are on
[flickr][flickr], most of them are licensed under some Creative Commons
license.

Somehow I fell in love with technology which is why I spend my days (and most of
my nights, too) with developing software and improving things. Some people may
call me a hacker, which may be the result of me being interested in software
security or the fact that I am obsessed with XMPP (and IRC), and my server
monitoring and my room heater's control speak XMPP with me. Yes, my heater's
control talks XMPP.

# Software development

Most of the time I develop web applications. Thus I am able to create software
using JavaScript, Ruby, Python, C and even a bit of Rust.

I cannot decide between one of them, so I work with [Ruby on Rails][rails] and
[Django][django] - depends on the project. I know rails and I'm concerned about
my privacy. That's why I really like the [Diaspora\* project][diaspora] and so
I am also work there a bit.

There is a [dedicated page about my projects][projects] and I suggest that you
check it out if you want to learn more about who I am and what I work on. Do not
hesitate to [contact me][contact] if you have any questions or if you want to
get in touch with me.
