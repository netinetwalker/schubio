title: Shy blog posts

<p>
  These blog posts are old. Very old. I found them in backups of my older website
  versions. Since I blogged German stuff back then, the posts are written in
  (bad) German. Maybe I'll translate them some day...
</p>

<section id="blogposts">
{% assign_posts show: shy %}
{% for post in posts %}
  <article>
    <h3><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h3>
    <p class="metaline">
      <span class="dateline"><i class="icon-date"></i> {{ post.date | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}</span>
      <span class="tagline"><i class="icon-tag"></i> {{ post.tags | join: ", " }}</span>
    </p>
  </article>
{% endfor %}
</section>
