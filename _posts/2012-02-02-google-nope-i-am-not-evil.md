I just got an interesting mail for 3 of my domains:

> Dear site owner or webmaster of [domain],

> We recently discovered that some pages on your site look like a possible

Wow. That's interesting. That sites are absolutely not phishing sites, one of
those even has no formular on it! Does anyone have an idea how Googles
algorithm works?

Luckily dennis-schubert.de is not on the list of the kicked out domains. The
domains Google kicked out are just some kind of "private projects" nobody
should take care of. But that's still interesting...
