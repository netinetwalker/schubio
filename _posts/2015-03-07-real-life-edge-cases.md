This post may be a bit depressing, and I want to apologize in advance, but I
think this topic is worth the bad mood. I want to write about real life edge
cases and how we should deal with them. Originally, I thought about pointing out
one specific issue raised by a friend of mine, but after some days of thinking,
I realized this could be a more general post.

The friend I was going to talk about is [Mihai][mihai]. Mihai is a Romanian
software developer working at Mozilla for the Developer Tools team. Mihai has
[Epidermolysis Bullosa][wiki-eb] (sometimes abbreviated as EB): EB is an
inherited tissue disease and basically makes your skin really fragile. I will
not go into detail here; you can do that on your own if you are interested.
[Mihai did a great job on raising awareness to EB][mihai-touched], and there is
no need of duplicating contents; just go ahead and read his article. You should
read [Joe Walker's post about Mihai and his work][console-mihai], too, but I
want to highlight a very touching paragraph:

However, I wrote I will not get stuck on a single point. I tend to call diseases
like E.B. "edge cases", as this pretty much sums it up. Only very few people can
reproduce them, fixing them is sometimes almost impossible, and dealing with
them can be pretty hard, too. Still, humans are humans, no matter if they have
broken components or not.

First, I think we should support all edge cases in some way. Obviously, it is
good to raise awareness of certain points to get attention, but we should not
forget about all the other edge cases out there. Supporting specific
organizations (for example supporting EB research) is not bad, but other
organizations need money for research, too!

Are you aware of funds supporting research on Alzheimer's diseases? Did you know
there are organizations researching and fixing (or, at least, trying to fix)
speech diseases?

You do not have to donate to such organizations if you do not want to. Nobody
will get mad at you. But keep one thing in mind: for each edge case, there are
people affected by it. And those people are normal humans, too. Some people have
special needs, but we all do have special needs to a certain degree. People with
physical or mental problems are not stupid, and you should not treat them as if
they are. Because that really hurts.

If you meet a personified edge cases, treat them like every other person. If you
are unsure about certain things, just ask. Nobody will hurt you if you ask
questions, but people will feel hurt if you act weird. You do not have to speak
loud and slow to people with paraplegia, and you do not have to complete
sentences from people with speech issues. Also, please take all the issues
seriously, and do not claim people are just "acting up to get attention". This
also applies to less edge-casy issues, especially mental disorders.

I am serious here. Those points may sound small and negligible to you, but they
might really hurt the people affected by edge cases. I found myself in some
pretty bad situations where I had to fight with myself, for example, after I
finished a job interview with 30 minutes of stuttering and no real talk because
of that. Adding triggers for bad mood does not help at all. The world would be a
so much better place if everyone would get this.

Last but not least, I would like to give kudos to everyone affected by edge
cases and dealing with them. It is hard. I know. But you are awesome. And you do
make the world a better place by subliminally sharing your attitude.

I had to get this off my chest. Thank you.
