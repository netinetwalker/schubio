2011 was a interesting year for all of us. We worked a lot, we learned a lot
and we made mistakes. I realized there are some people who helped me in various
situations and it seems to be very unusual to say "thank you" nowadays. Let's
do it.

Thanks to:

* Markus Abrell and Sebastian Gruhler for helping me doing all the Diaspora
  work I could not do alone. Also thanks for providing great days and funny
  train rides. ;-)
* [Angelo Gründler][angelo] for providing a save Swiss infrastructure and for
  spending a lot of time keeping it running.
* [Jonne Hass][jonne] for taking over tons of work to protect at least 1% of my
  free time. ;-)
* [Karsten Janke][oberth] for helping me designing various stuff. I can
  recommend him for business cards, logos, websites, whatever!
* [Marius Şucan][marius] for showing me awesome art and providing his own
  uncensored oppinion whenever I asked for.
* [Mihai Şucan][mihai] for teaching me some things about technologies and
  discussing about them.
* Ilya Zhitomirskiy for motivating and talking about various nerd stuff. R.I.P.
* [Daniel Grippi][daniel], [Sarah Mei][sarah], [Maxwell Salzberg][max],
  [Raphael Sofear][raph] and all the other Diaspora dudes for developing an
  open source, decentralized social network. You guys rock!

I am pretty sure there are people I forgot to put on that list. Please ping me!

Guess what would be nice? More people saying "thank you" to each other. I am
going to ask the people I mentioned above to write a list like that, too. It's
your turn!

Have a nice day.
