Ilya Zitomirskiy, a 22 years young hacker and co-founder of Diaspora\* died
today. He was one of that always-motivated guys and he always shared his
motivation with all his friends and contacts. My sincerest condolences to
Ilyaâ€™s family, friends and everyone else out there.

Ilya motivated me to work at Diaspora\* and he was the guy answering all my
questions regarding Diaspora\*'s development. We had contact on a nearly
day-to-day basis - not always regarding Diaspora\* and I really can say: he was
just awesome. I cannot describe what I am feeling right now.
