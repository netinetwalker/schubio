We are living in a world changing very fast. New technologies are popping up
and old technologies are disappering on a day-to-day basis and we are not
really thinking about what is going on. Big things are going on right now:
HTML5, CSS3, IPv6, ...

I just had the idea to write down the technolgies I am using right now, write
another article in some years and compare them both. So, let's start!
