firefox-tabgroups is a Firefox add-on that aims to provide a simple add-on to
replace some functionalities from TabView/Tab Groups/Panorama which were
removed from Firefox due to a lot of open bugs and a very low overall usage.

While the backend is compatible with the old data from the original Firefox
sources, the frontend was built using React and Redux to create a frontend that
should be easy to maintain and extend in the future.
