Lilly (because it is a "link list" and "lili" looks weird) is a minimalistic
"read it later" web application. I created this little app because I was not
happy with keeping articles "stared" or unread in my feed reader nor with
storing emails in my inbox. Browser bookmarks are nicer, but still not
synchronized between all my devices.

It supports dragging links (and even Firefox tabs) into it and it will store
the links into a small JSON file stored on the server. Lilly makes use of
Underscore.js, Backbone's event machine and React (in fact, it was a playground
to test some React patterns).
