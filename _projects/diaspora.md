diaspora\* is a free and open source plattform to build a distributed social
network. diaspora\* is built on Ruby on Rails and nowadays providing a web
application with large parts of the applications view logic done on the client
side.

I contribute to the project since its very first day, where it got crowdfunded
on Kickstarter back in 2010. As a long-time contributor, I mainly work on
keeping the project alive and running well by managing tasks, reviewing code,
doing code reviews, fixing code, answering press inquires, ... you get the idea.
